# Deskclock
Fork of aosp clock. Package name changed, added power off alarm function(alarm will ring with phone off, snapdragon phones only, tested on lineageos)

Thanks to Chen Luo for creating the original fork https://github.com/Chen-Luo/Deskclock

Anyone is welcome to improve the app. Forks, pull requests, and additional functions are appreciated.
I'm not a developer (it was a stroke of luck to be able to generate the apk)
