<i>Deskclock</i> is a fork of the AOSP clock, so it offers all its functions:

* alarms
* stop-watch
* count-down "timer" (aka "tea timer")

Additionally, it adds "power-off alarm function" (alarm will ring with phone off, Snapdragon phones only, tested on LineageOS and should work on all AOSP ROMs; currently does not work on MIUI).
